        This was an amazing bootcamp in which I have learnt a lot about
        JavaScript and React.Js. Everything was explained so well. Will love to
        join more such bootcamps from ShapeAI. This bootcamp was taken up by
        Shaurya Sinha and such a great teacher he is. He explained complex to
        complex topics so easily.
